SpaceBar is a game where you play as a bartender and interact with your clients through your cocktails. 

How to play: Using the arrow keys to navigate through your finest collection of drinks and the Z key to select them, you will be able to mix them in different combinations in order to advise your 3 different clients on how they should react to a certain problem they present you.

Regarding your cocktails, they must consist of 1 out of 2 base ingredients and 1 out of 3 reagents, maxing a total of 6 combinations.

In this game, since every combination influences the client’s response to a certain situation in a different way, you will be able to find 10 different outcomes for your clients’ story (and for yours).
